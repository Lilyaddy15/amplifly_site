                <p class="text-accessible-gray text-lg">
                  Hi, I'm Lily ðŸ‘‹ I'm the founder of Amplifly and a passionate advocate for neurodivergent voices. As someone who understands the beauty and challenge of navigating the world with a unique mind, I created Amplifly to turn insight into empowerment. I believe we deserve tools built for our needsâ€”not just adapted to them. With a background in engineering and a heart rooted in advocacy, I'm building Amplifly to make thriving more accessible for all of us.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-navy mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="text-accessible-gray mb-6">
              Our mission is to empower neurodivergent individuals by combining biometric data and AI to deliver real-time support, personalized insights, and a deeper understanding of our minds and bodiesâ€”so we can thrive on our own terms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-accessible-gray">
              We envision a world where neurodivergent people are supported by technology that understands themâ€”not one that asks them to change.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-deep-navy mb-6">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="text-accessible-gray mb-6">
              Amplifly was born from lived experience. Like many neurodivergent people, we've faced overwhelm, burnout, and the pressure to "mask" just to get through the day. Traditional wellness tools didn't understand usâ€”so we built one that does.
            </p>
            <p class="text-accessible-gray">
              What started as an idea to track energy has evolved into a dynamic app that connects biometric data with emotional support, giving users personalized guidance when they need it most. Backed by cutting-edge AI and a deep respect for neurodiversity, Amplifly is here to change the story from survival to self-regulation, confidence, and empowerment.
